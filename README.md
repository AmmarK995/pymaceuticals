Comprehensive data regarding a Pharmaceutical's animal study was cleaned and analysed using Python. The sample included 249 mice, which were tested with 10 different drugs, and subsequent tumour growth.

The data was combined in a Dataframe and basic statistical calculations were conducted, alongside bar charts and pie charts.

Due to hurdles faced in the later sections such as Boxplots, regression analysis, etc, help was sought from ChatGPT, and similar calculations done by benanza (https://github.com/benanza/Pymaceuticals/tree/master) were also referenced.
